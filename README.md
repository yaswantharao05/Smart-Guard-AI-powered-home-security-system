# Smart-Guard: AI-powered Home Security System

Smart-Guard is an AI-powered IoT-based home security system designed to enhance residential safety using facial recognition, access monitoring, and real-time video processing. The system identifies and logs known housemates while detecting and reporting intruders via email alerts. A simple GUI built using Qt (C++) provides interactive control and monitoring.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 📸 Face Detection
CCTV footage is continuously captured, and facial regions are identified using Python-based detection algorithms.

### 🧑‍🦰 Face Recognition
Extracted faces are matched against a preloaded housemate database using facial feature encodings and landmarks.

### 🔍 Classification

- **Housemates**: Verified and logged with timestamp.
- **Strangers**: Unrecognized faces staring >5 seconds trigger alerts.

### 📩 Report Generation & Notification
For strangers, a report (with image & timestamp) is sent to the homeowner via email using SMTP.

### 🔁 Continuous Learning & Smart Integration
The system adapts over time to improve recognition and integrates with smart home devices like locks or sensors.

## 💻 GUI Pipeline

### Step 1: Running the Application

Run the `.exe` file to launch the Smart-Guard application.

### Step 2: User Verification

Click the **‘Verify’** button to begin the verification process.

### Step 3: Terminal Background Operations

Behind the scenes:
- Virtual environment is activated
- `face%20recognition.py` script is executed

### Step 4: Load Housemate Images

Face encodings of housemates are preloaded for comparison.

### Step 5: Real-time Video Capture

Webcam captures real-time frames, which are processed for recognition.

### Step 6: Face Comparison & Classification

Each frame is checked to determine if the face matches a known housemate.

### Step 7: GUI Output

- **Housemate**: Green screen with a voice greeting.

- **Stranger**: Red screen with a warning message and voice alert.
